The problem is "cannot start the Ubuntu system"
## The Ubuntu system cannot be started due to blocking memory. 
This problem is due to running out of the memory. To solve this problem, you need to get into the system first through the SFC page, and then check the size of each file. The problem can be solved by removing the unused files with large size.
